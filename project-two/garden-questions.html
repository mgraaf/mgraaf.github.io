    <h1>Garden Questions - Running List</h1>

    <p><mark>Green and crossed out means it's been figured out!</mark></p>

    <h2>Welcome Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Nothing... Yet!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plot Picker Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="done">ON PAGE LOAD? How to open the modal immediately on the page loading, rather than the user having to click a button to get the modal to open?</li>
      <li>MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li>BUTTON POSITION? Figure out how to position modal and restart buttons without them doing weird things to the positions of things around them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Circle Plot Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="done">HOW TO REVERT FOR EVERYONE? Drag and drop with “revert if outside drop zone” function is only working for whoever is last in the order, in the case of trying to apply it to multiple elements</li>
      <li>MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li>SAVE TO DESKTOP? How to create save button that allows users to save the image of the garden they create to their desktop (laptop) or Camera Roll (touchscreen)?</li>
      <li>CLONING DRAGGABLES? How to “clone” vegetables so there’s always one in the sidebar that can be dragged onto the plot — basically, a never-ending supply?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Square Plot Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="done">HOW TO REVERT FOR EVERYONE? Drag and drop with “revert if outside drop zone” function is only working for whoever is last in the order, in the case of trying to apply it to multiple elements</li>
      <li>MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li>CLONING DRAGGABLES? How to “clone” vegetables so there’s always one in the sidebar that can be dragged onto the plot — basically, a never-ending supply?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gallery Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>GALLERY IMAGES IN BOXES? How to position the images so that they are within the confines of their box, rather than hanging over the edge like Mr. Whiskers? Can they be positioned and still keep their modal capabilities? </li>
      <ul>
        <li>NOTE: It’s affected by the size of the text in the boxes, for example — something to do with sharing div? Put the images in their own divs and resize to avoid the problem?</li>
      </ul>
      <li>WHAT’S UP WITH THE TOP MARGIN? Why is the top margin on this page larger than the top margin on the build and home pages?</li>
      <li>WHY IS THE TITLE TEXT THROWING STUFF OFF? Trying to position the title h2 text throws off all the gallery images in their flexbox container -- what's happening?</li>
      <li>MODAL CAPTION - FONT? How to change the font of the captions in image modals?</li>
    </ul>
