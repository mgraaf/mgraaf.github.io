    <h1>Garden Questions - Running List</h1>

    <p><mark>Green and crossed out means it's been figured out!</mark></p>

    <h2>General or Site-Wide</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>SIZING ON IPAD? When viewed on an iPad, the page appears "zoomed out" - rather than the 768 px X 1024 px section filling the screen, the site comes in with extra background showing aroung the sides and bottom edge, appearing smaller than full-screen instead of filling the screen with the main content. Is there any way to fix this positioning/sizing issue? See a screenshot <a href="ipad-example.png">here</a> for reference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Welcome Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="done">Nothing... Yet!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plot Picker Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="done">ON PAGE LOAD? How to open the modal immediately on the page loading, rather than the user having to click a button to get the modal to open?</li>
      <li class="done">MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li class="done">BUTTON POSITION? Figure out how to position modal and restart buttons without them doing weird things to the positions of things around them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Circle Plot Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>SAVE TO DESKTOP? How to create save button that allows users to save the image of the garden they create to their desktop (laptop) or Camera Roll (touchscreen)?</li>
      <li>POSITION? Carrots 1-7, positioned absolutely, don't move with the browser window when re-scaled, but turning off position absolute on them causes the "stack o' carrots" in the sidebar to break up</li>
      <li class="done">HOW TO REVERT FOR EVERYONE? Drag and drop with “revert if outside drop zone” function is only working for whoever is last in the order, in the case of trying to apply it to multiple elements</li>
      <li class="done">MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li class="done">CLONING DRAGGABLES? How to “clone” vegetables so there’s always one in the sidebar that can be dragged onto the plot — basically, a never-ending supply?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Square Plot Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>SAVE TO DESKTOP? How to create save button that allows users to save the image of the garden they create to their desktop (laptop) or Camera Roll (touchscreen)?</li>
      <li>POSITION? Carrots 1-7, positioned absolutely, don't move with the browser window when re-scaled, but turning off position absolute on them causes the "stack o' carrots" in the sidebar to break up</li>
      <li class="done">HOW TO REVERT FOR EVERYONE? Drag and drop with “revert if outside drop zone” function is only working for whoever is last in the order, in the case of trying to apply it to multiple elements</li>
      <li class="done">MAKE ‘EM STICKY? Save button and bunny div are moving when the screen resizes, whereas everyone else is sticking in their assigned places — how to corral these wayward elements?</li>
      <li class="done">CLONING DRAGGABLES? How to “clone” vegetables so there’s always one in the sidebar that can be dragged onto the plot — basically, a never-ending supply?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gallery Page</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>MODAL CAPTION - FONT? How to change the font of the captions in image modals?</li>
      <li class="done">GALLERY IMAGES IN BOXES? How to position the images so that they are within the confines of their box, rather than hanging over the edge like Mr. Whiskers? Can they be positioned and still keep their modal capabilities? </li>
      <ul>
        <li class="done">NOTE: It’s affected by the size of the text in the boxes, for example — something to do with sharing div? Put the images in their own divs and resize to avoid the problem?</li>
      </ul>
      <li class="done">WHAT’S UP WITH THE TOP MARGIN? Why is the top margin on this page larger than the top margin on the build and home pages?</li>
      <li class="done">WHY IS THE TITLE TEXT THROWING STUFF OFF? Trying to position the title h2 text throws off all the gallery images in their flexbox container -- what's happening?</li>
    </ul>
